Then we’ll discuss scaling your business in \\nthe chapters in Part 3: Grow It.\\n6. “I don’t have enough time to create a business.”\\nLook for the processes you can automate, or document parts of \\nthe business so you can hire someone to help. My productivity \\nsystem (chapter 9) allows me to run an  eight-  figure business, a \\nYouTube channel, and a blog, while working out daily, travel-\\ning, and so on. If it’s a priority, we can make the time.\\n7 . “I need to read more books, do more research, \\nand be totally prepared before I can really start.”\\nYou will never feel 100 percent ready to start. You just need to \\nstart. Don’t buy another book or watch another video until \\nyou’ve worked through THIS process and started your  million- \\n dollar business. I got you. Action time (chapter 1)!\\n8. “I’m broke as @#!*. I’ve spent so much money \\nand have made zero dollars in profit.”\\nDon’t spend another dime until you’ve made your first dollar. \\nThe  Million   Dollar Weekend process (chapter 5) requires no \\nup- front spending.\\n9. “I’m not good at marketing.”\\nMarketing is easy when you have a product people want. \\nChapter 3 shows you step by step how to find ideas people are \\nexcited to give you money for. Then chapters 6, 7, and 8 give \\nyou the same marketing methods that I used to help Mint \\nMillion_9780593539774_all_8p_r1.indd xi 11/18/23 6:26 PM\\nCopyrighted Material'),\n",
